# AlphaCare Insurance Solutions: Risk and Predictive Analytics

### Overview
This project focuses on optimizing AlphaCare Insurance Solutions' car insurance marketing strategy in South Africa. As part of the data analytics team, the primary goal is to analyze historical insurance claim data, identifying "low-risk" targets for premium reduction. By doing so, AlphaCare can attract new clients while refining its product offerings for different customer demographics.

### Business Objective
The analysis covers various facets, such as exploring how risk and profit margins differ across regions (provinces, zip codes) and customer characteristics (gender). We conducted A/B hypothesis testing to determine significant differences and fitted linear regression models to predict total claims per zip code. Furthermore, machine learning techniques were employed to develop predictive models for optimal insurance premiums based on features like car details, owner profiles, and geographic location.

### Methodology
Our statistical testing included Chi-Squared tests for categorical data (e.g., gender) and T-tests for numerical data (e.g., risk scores across regions). These tests were conducted to validate hypotheses about customer behavior and risk segmentation. In addition, machine learning models were trained to assess which features most influence insurance premiums, providing insights to improve AlphaCare's pricing strategy.

### Results
The statistical analysis revealed significant risk differences across provinces and between men and women, as well as notable profit margin disparities between zip codes. However, no significant risk differences were found across zip codes. These insights allow AlphaCare to tailor its marketing approach, focusing on areas where customer risk and profitability are most impacted.
